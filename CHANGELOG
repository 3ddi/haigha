0.2.3
=====

First changelog.

Removed manipulation of channels in Connection.disconnect(). It's now up to the application to manage channels when explicitly shutting down a connection or when the socket is dropped and the strategy reconnects. This fixed a problem wherein an application may have created a connection, created some channels and queued operations on them, but it takes the strategy a few attempts before completing a socket connection.

Fixed character escpaing when logging outbound ContentFrames.
